How many rows will come in outputs of Left, Right, Inner and outer join from two tables having duplicate rows.4


Let's consider two tables, Table A and Table B, each with duplicate rows. For simplicity, we'll assume both tables have two columns: `id` and `value`. We'll use the following data for our example:

Table A:
| id | value |
|----|-------|
| 1  | A     |
| 2  | B     |
| 3  | C     |
| 1  | D     |
| 4  | E     |

Table B:
| id | value |
|----|-------|
| 3  | X     |
| 1  | Y     |
| 5  | Z     |
| 1  | W     |
| 2  | V     |

Now, let's see how many rows will be in the outputs of Left, Right, Inner, and Outer joins:

1. **Left Join (Table A LEFT JOIN Table B):**

The Left Join will keep all the rows from Table A and match the rows from Table B based on the `id` column. It will include all the rows from Table A, and if there is a match in Table B, it will combine the rows. If there's no match, it will still include the row from Table A, and the columns from Table B will be filled with NULL.

Output of Left Join:

| id | value | id  | value |
|----|-------|-----|-------|
| 1  | A     | 1   | Y     |
| 1  | A     | 1   | W     |
| 2  | B     | 2   | V     |
| 3  | C     | 3   | X     |
| 1  | D     | 1   | Y     |
| 1  | D     | 1   | W     |
| 4  | E     | NULL| NULL  |

Total rows: 7

2. **Right Join (Table A RIGHT JOIN Table B):**

The Right Join will keep all the rows from Table B and match the rows from Table A based on the `id` column. It will include all the rows from Table B, and if there is a match in Table A, it will combine the rows. If there's no match, it will still include the row from Table B, and the columns from Table A will be filled with NULL.

Output of Right Join:

| id   | value | id  | value |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| 3    | X     | 3   | X     |
| 1    | Y     | 1   | A     |
| 1    | Y     | 1   | D     |
| 1    | W     | 1   | A     |
| 1    | W     | 1   | D     |
| 2    | V     | 2   | B     |
| NULL | NULL  | 5   | Z     |

Total rows: 7

3. **Inner Join (Table A INNER JOIN Table B):**

The Inner Join will only include the rows that have matching `id` values in both Table A and Table B.

Output of Inner Join:

| id | value | id  | value |
|----|-------|-----|-------|
| 1  | A     | 1   | Y     |
| 1  | A     | 1   | W     |
| 1  | D     | 1   | Y     |
| 1  | D     | 1   | W     |
| 2  | B     | 2   | V     |
| 3  | C     | 3   | X     |

Total rows: 6

4. **Outer Join (Table A FULL OUTER JOIN Table B):**

The Full Outer Join will keep all the rows from both Table A and Table B, and combine the rows where there is a match based on the `id` column. If there's no match in one of the tables, it will still include the row from that table, and the columns from the other table will be filled with NULL.

Output of Outer Join:

| id   | value | id  | value |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| 1    | A     | 1   | Y     |
| 1    | A     | 1   | W     |
| 1    | D     | 1   | Y     |
| 1    | D     | 1   | W     |
| 2    | B     | 2   | V     |
| 3    | C     | 3   | X     |
| 4    | E     | NULL| NULL  |
| NULL | NULL  | 5   | Z     |

Total rows: 8

In summary, the number of rows in the output of Left Join, Right Join, Inner Join, and Outer Join can vary depending on the data and the join conditions. It's essential to understand the data and the purpose of the join to choose the appropriate join type for your query.
